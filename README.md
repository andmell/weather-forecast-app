# weather-forecast-app

## Description
This application was created to give the user a way to search for the weather data for any input city. The application includes extensive JavaScript, and dynamically creates elements through DOM traversal. 

## Installation
This is a webpage deployed through GitHub's native webpage deployment software. You can navigate to the page [here](https://andmell.github.io/weather-forecast-app/).

## Usage
On the webpage, type a name of a city and click on the "get weather!" button. The weather data should appear to the right of the search bar. In addition, the search will be saved below the search
bar. The saved search will persist through reload, and is interactable; if clicked, the webpage will display weather data for the respective city clicked. The data will include the city name searched, the date, an icon of the weather, a description of the weather conditions, temperature in Fahrenheit, relative humidity percentage, and wind speed in miles per hour. 

In addition, the application will also display the weather data for the next five days. It will include an icon of the weather, the temperature in Fahrenheit, the relative humidity percentage, and wind speed.
